# Exercise 1.7
# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of 
# $500,000 with Guidoâ€™s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin 
# trading corporation. The interest rate is 5% and the monthly 
# payment is $2684.11.
# Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave 
# will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:


initial = 500000
monthly = 2684.11
interest = 0.05

total_paid = 0.0

while initial > 0:
    initial = initial * (1+interest/12) - monthly
    total_paid = total_paid + monthly

print('Total paid', total_paid)

# Suppose Dave pays an extra $1000/month for the first 12 months of the mortgage?
# Modify the program to incorporate this extra payment and have it print the total 
# amount paid along with the number of months required.
